          <h3>Gravitational Waves</h3>
          <p>Gravitational waves are humankind's newest way to view
            the heavens and the neutron star mergers and core-collapse
            supernovae that TEAMS studies are among the strongest
            sources.</p>
        </div>

	<div class="row 100% uniform">
	  <div class="4u 12u(medium)">
	    <p>Neutron star mergers have now been observed to produce
              strong gravitational wave (GW) emission that can total
              more than a percent of the rest mass energy.  Such
              signals should be observable with advanced LIGO at
              distances of 100 Megaparsecs or more.  Comparison of GW
              detections with simulations can be used to infer the
              parameters of the binary and provide important
              constraints on the physics of nuclear matter.  </p>

            <p>The GW emission from core-collapse supernovae is
              expected to be much smaller, and detectable only for
              events within our own Galaxy, except perhaps for rare
              cases of rapidly rotating progenitors.  Nonetheless, the
              greater frequency of core-collapse supernovae and the
              combined physics payload of a Galactic CCSN, with its
              accompanying neutrino and gravitational wave signals,
              compels us to push the frontier of gravitational wave
              prediction for such events forward. </p>

          <h3>Neutrinos</h3>

          <p>Almost all of the energy from core-collapse supernovae is radiated in the form
            of neutrinos. This emission is key to both the explosion mechanism itself and to
            many of the subsequent observables, including the nucleosynthesis.  Neutrinos were
            observed in the case of Supernova 1987a which exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
            There are several large, underground neutrino detectors (e.g. Super-K and IceCube)
            are currently operational, and others are planned in the near future (e.g. DUNE),
            increasing our confidence that a high-statistics SN neutrino signal will eventually
            be observed. </p>

          <p>Observations of supernova neutrinos will shed important light on the physics of the
            proto-neutron star at the center of a core-collapse supernovae.  These observations
            also have the potential to teach us important lessons about neutrinos themselves.
            Many properties of neutrinos are now known, including the mass-squared mass
            differences and vacuum mixing angles. But, the detection of neutrinos from a Galactic
            core-collapse supernovae (or neutron star merger) could reveal the neutrino mass
            hierarchy, their Dirac or Majorana nature, and the possibility of sterile states.</p>

          <h3>Electromagnetic Radiation</h3>

          <p>By far the  most commonly observed signals of stellar explosions are
            electromagnetic. Wide-field surveys are currently discovering multiple SNe every day,
            many of which are followed up with panchromatic photometry and spectroscopy. Future
            surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) are expected to discover
            hundreds of thousands of SNe and other explosive transients.</p>

          <p>Photons are primarily radiated after the explosion itself, as ejected matter
            emits thermally in  ultraviolet, visible and infrared bands with a luminosity visible
            for months to years.  In addition to the thermal energy deposited by the explosion
            itself, the supernova light curve can be powered by the decay of radioactive isotopes
            synthesized in the explosion, and, in some cases, by long-term activity of the central
            remnant (e.g., a rotating, magnetized neutron star or accreting black hole).
            Non-thermal radiation from radioactive decay can be detected in x-ray/gamma-ray bands
            for very nearby events and Galactic SN remnants. The panchromatic light curves and
            spectra provide a wealth of information as to the  mass, kinetic energy, radioactive
            content, and elemental composition of the material ejected in the explosion.</p>

          <p>Simulating the electromagnetic emission from stellar explosion models requires
            3-D time-dependent multi-wavelength Boltzmann transport, coupled to the thermodynamics
            of the expanding, radioactively heated ejecta. Because the timescale for photon
            diffusion is typically much longer than that of the explosion itself, the problem
            can usually be treated in post-processing. The initial conditions of the photon
            transport calculation are the density, velocity, temperature, and composition of the
            ejecta once hydrodynamical effects have abated.  The dynamical evolution thereafter
            is simple free-expansion, with the gas temperature and ionization state set by a
            strong matter-radiation coupling that must be calculated implicitly.</p>
