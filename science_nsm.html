	  <h2>Neutron Star Mergers</h2>
        </header>

        <p>A small fraction of all neutron stars (NS) end their life
          with a violent collision with another compact object,
          another NS or a Black Hole (BH). These collisions can be
          driven by the loss of orbital energy due to the emission of
          gravitational waves at the end of a complex binary
          evolution, or they can occur as a result of many-body
          interactions in dense stellar environments (for example, in
          globular clusters).  Presently, about a dozen double NS
          systems in and around our galaxy are known.  Of these,
          roughly half will merge within a few billions of
          years. There are currently no known NS-BH binaries. </p>

        <p>The estimated event rates based on these observations and
          other means are still very uncertain. For double NS
          binaries, the merger rate estimates range from one every
          thousand years to one every million years for a galaxy lik
          ours. The rates for NS-BH binaries are even more uncertain,
          with one predicted every 10,000 to 100 million years per
          Milky-Way-type galaxy.</p>

        <p>Despite being rare events, these mergers are violent enough
          to produce photons throughout the entire electromagnetic
          spectrum (from the radio to hard X-rays and &#947;-ray)
          detectable at intergalactic distances.  Indeed, these
          mergers typically result in the formation of a black hole
          surrounded by thick, massive (roughly solar mass) and hot
          accretion disk that accrete on a timescale of less than a
          second.  These systems are expected to produce relativistic
          jets and are considered the most likely candidates for the
          central engine of short &#947;-ray bursts.</p>

        <p>These mergers are one of the main target of gravitational
          wave detectors like LIGO, which is expected to detect them
          at distances as large as hundreds of Megaparsecs.  More
          importantly for TEAMS, NS mergers should result in the
          dynamical ejection of up to 1% of a solar mass of formerly
          NS matter due to tidal torques or shocks during the
          merger. These outflows are expected to be very neutron rich,
          because they are made of catalyzed neutron star material,
          and thus robustly produce r-process elements. </p>
